  abstract = {We present StarSpace, a general-purpose neural embedding model that can solve
a wide variety of problems: labeling tasks such as text classification, ranking
tasks such as information retrieval/web search, collaborative filtering-based
or content-based recommendation, embedding of multi-relational graphs, and
learning word, sentence or document level embeddings. In each case the model
works by embedding those entities comprised of discrete features and comparing
them against each other -- learning similarities dependent on the task.
Empirical results on a number of tasks show that StarSpace is highly
competitive with existing methods, whilst also being generally applicable to
new cases where those methods are not.},

@misc{barkan2016item2vec,
  abstract = {Many Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms are item-based in the sense that
they analyze item-item relations in order to produce item similarities.
Recently, several works in the field of Natural Language Processing suggested
to learn a latent representation of words using neural embedding algorithms.
Among them, the Skip-gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS), also known as
Word2Vec, was shown to provide state-of-the-art results on various linguistics
tasks. In this paper, we show that item-based CF can be cast in the same
framework of neural word embedding. Inspired by SGNS, we describe a method we
name Item2Vec for item-based CF that produces embedding for items in a latent
space. The method is capable of inferring item-to-item relations even when user
information is not available. We present experimental results on large scale
datasets that demonstrate the effectiveness of the Item2Vec method and show it
is competitive with SVD.},

@incollection{mikolov2013distributed,
  abstract = {The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this paper we present several improvements that make the Skip-gram model more expressive and enable it to learn higher quality vectors more rapidly. We show that by subsampling frequent words we obtain significant speedup, and also learn higher quality representations as measured by our tasks. We also introduce Negative Sampling, a simplified variant of Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) that learns more accurate vectors for frequent words compared to the hierarchical softmax. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of Canada'' and "Air'' cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada''. Motivated by this example, we present a simple and efficient method for finding phrases, and show that their vector representations can be accurately learned by the Skip-gram model.},
